# Motivation
## Fitness

My training partner and I perform most of our strength training exercises with a timer. We do this to better keep track of our progress and keep ourselves honest and less cheaty. An exercise like a pushup for us may consist of 4 parts (going down -> staying down -> pushing up -> staying up), each of the parts have their own time slot (the timespan in which a particular part of a movement should be performed), so in the pushup example a single pushup could consist of a 3212 sequence (3s going down -> 2s staying down -> 1s pushing up -> 2s staying up). If we are doing 10 of these the timing is getting tricky for regular HIIT apps and even trickier if we are doing exercises in sequence or supersets. There are great apps that do this already, but I wanted to try it my way. Also, an additional reason is...

## Programming

Wanted to create a PWA as an exercise and to develop my programming skills. I am somewhat new to the field so feel free to recommend or criticize.
