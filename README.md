### TODOS

- refactor SVG buttons to use one component and then create a component for each svg
- screen brighter on pause
- color constants are in two places (scss variables and util/constants)
- if progress bar exceeds a certain aount of circles then just display as numbers
- increment speed on longer button press
- no sleep not working in firefox
- first beep is sometimes off
- navigation bar black fades to opaque to blend better with block color
- different sounds for each block
- counting sets voice
- maybe tap bloc to make active and then possible to edit
