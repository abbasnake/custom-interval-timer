### TODOS
- unit tests
- e2e tests
- loops can be as components that can be mixed and matched and saved and loaded
- desktop mode
- swipe functionality
- maybe move mutations to actions, so that more than one mutation can be used in single dispatch/commit
- refactor SVG buttons to use one component and then create a component for each svg
- make small png icon for mobile/splash screen
- screen brighter on pause
- color constants are in two places (scss variables and util/constants)
- if user sets one of timers to 00:00, ignore it
- if progress bar exceeds a certain aount of circles then just display as numbers
- increment speed on longer button press
- no sleep not working in firefox
- first beep is sometimes off
- start button always at bottom
- bigger and bold font for start button
- increase area of effect for arrow buttons, maybe size as well
- navigation bar black fades to opaque to blend better with block color
- different sounds for each block
- counting sets voice
- maybe tap bloc to make active and then possible to edit
